# Camunda Optimize Frontend

## Requirements

Node 14.15.4+
Docker 17.12.0+
Docker Compose 1.21.0+
[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## Installation

Install yarn
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

## Login to GCP

GCP is used to store artifacts that will be downloaded automatically.
First, a login to GCP is needed (if you don't have access, ask the infra team for it).

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

```bash
gcloud config set project ci-30-162810
```

## Development server

```bash
yarn run start-backend
```

Then in new terminal

```bash
yarn start
```

Backend also can be started without maven compilation step. It's possible only if there is already
compiled version of optimize backend at ``camunda-optimize/distro/target``.
To do that set ``FAST_BUILD`` environment on scope. For example:

```bash
export FAST_BUILD=1
yarn run start-backend
```

### Problems that may happen

If for some reason you are getting error try running from the root folder:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pit
```

process stops after elasticsearch is started - delete old data folder of ES

```bash
rm -rf ../distro/traget/distro/server/elasticsearch-6.0.0/data
```

## Production

```bash
yarn build
```

Should create ``build`` folder with built application.

## Unit Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

### Problems with Mac

If youâ€™re running a Mac and `yarn test` fails with something like:

```
2017-10-24 13:57 node[16138] (FSEvents.framework) FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc() => (null) (-22)
2017-10-24 13:57 node[16138] (FSEvents.framework) FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc() => (null) (-22)
2017-10-24 13:57 node[16138] (FSEvents.framework) FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc() => (null) (-22)
events.js:160
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: Error watching file for changes: EMFILE
    at exports._errnoException (util.js:1020:11)
    at FSEvent.FSWatcher._handle.onchange (fs.js:1420:11)
error Command failed with exit code 1.

```

you can make the tests run by installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

### Problems with Linux

If you're running a Linux system and `yarn test` fails with something like:

```
fs.js:1378
    throw error;
    ^


Waiting...Fatal error: watch ENOSPC
    at _errnoException (util.js:1024:11)
    at FSWatcher.start (fs.js:1376:19)
    ....
```
then you can find [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17437601) a solution for this.


## E2E Testing

Make sure you started the backend with `yarn run start-backend` and the frontend with `yarn start`.

```bash
yarn run e2e
```
