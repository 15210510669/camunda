/**
 * TODO: evaluate if this is really useful. If not, then we might just move the other classes to
 * test-util and leave it at that. Honestly this is probably over engineered, but it is kind of nice
 * to tie things together, as most of the time you really don't care about the individual
 * components.
 *
 * <p>A test harness to simplify testing {@link Exporter} instances in a synchronous context,
 * without requiring a complete broker.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>The harness follows the same lifecycle as the normal exporter. You <em>must</em> use it
 * accordingly, and it will fail when the lifecycle is bypassed.
 *
 * <p>This means it follows these rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the exporter must be closed before it can be configured
 *   <li>the exporter must be configured before it is opened
 *   <li>the exporter must be opened before it can export
 *   <li>the exporter must be opened or configured before it is closed
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: the harness starts with the exporter in a closed state.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: if the exporter is already configured, you can omit the call to {@link #open()} and skip
 * directly to {@link #export(Record)}, which will always open the exporter if it wasn't done yet.
 *
 * <h2>Scheduling tasks</h2>
 *
 * <p>As everything runs in a synchronous context, scheduled tasks are not run automatically.
 * Instead, they are simply collected when scheduled. To execute them, you must tick time manually
 * by calling {@link #runScheduledTasks(Duration)} with the appropriate duration. Time will be
 * increased by the given relative amount, and the scheduled tasks will be run sequentially,
 * synchronously, and ordered by their deadline. Note that if two tasks where supposed to be
 * executed at the same time, their order is undefined.
