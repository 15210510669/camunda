## Faster Dashboard and Alert Creation

Add data sources while creating a Collection, create dashboards with multi-process templates, and create Alerts directly from dashboards and reports.

## Improved Variable Support

Object variables imported from the Process Engine are flattened into simple variables for analysis. Variable filters can now be combined with OR logic, as well.

## Public API Endpoints

Developers can backup, migrate and control dashboards and reports programmatically using the public [REST API](https://docs.camunda.org/optimize/3.7/technical-guide/rest-api/). In addition, they can export the report data for offline analysis.
