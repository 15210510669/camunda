## Start and end date range filters

Expanded date ranges now include rolling and in progress ranges. It is also now possible to filter data by quarter.

## Dashboard layout improvement

When adding or moving a report, other reports on the dashboard automatically move to make space.

## User Task Report Improvements

When grouping user tasks by assignee, it is now possible to see user tasks that are not assigned to anyone.

## Suspended/Non-suspended instances filter for process report

 A new filter is added to allow for filtering the process instances that are in the suspended/non-suspended state. 

## Receive Alerts on custom notification systems using webhooks

Alerts can now be sent to external systems using webhooks. If you have any webhook configured, it will appear as an option when creating or updating an Alert.

## Event Based Processes

You can now create event based processes in Optimize. External events as well as Camunda Activity events of all imported Camunda BPM processes can be used to create those.
This allows you for the first time to create e.g. End-to-End processes that give you the power to create Optimize Reports that span multiple processes or even external systems.
