## Updated Report Templates
Report Templates help the user to visualize process execution data in a shareable report quickly. The new Report Templates give the user an overview of the different report visualizations and allow him to apply the template to his process data.

## Descriptions for reports and dashboards (All distributions)
Describing how to “read” visualized data and the context of why exactly this data is displayed greatly improves the readability of reports and dashboards. With 3.10, we introduced Text Reports that can be added as tiles, similar to other reports, and allow to place descriptions directly beside reports. This release added description fields directly related to reports and dashboards. 


## Carbon Design migration (All distributions)
We are in the process of migrating Camunda Optimize UI to use the Carbon Design System. Our primary focus is to bring the Optimize UI in line with other Camunda products, providing a consistent and seamless experience across the entire ecosystem. With this migration, we will also adhere to accessibility best practices, ensuring that our application is usable by a broader range of users.

The migration to the Carbon Design System for Camunda Optimize is an ongoing effort. We have successfully migrated modals, tables, and popovers, ensuring these components seamlessly integrate into the new design. While the functionality you love remains intact, you can expect a refreshing new UI that aligns with the Carbon Design System.
