## Copy tiles directly on a dashboard
Optimize allows the copying of any existing tile directly on the dashboard. This allows you to e.g., compare certain variants of the process with each other easily. The report tile can be copied with its configuration. The configuration of the new tile can be adjusted to certain variants for comparison with the initial report.


## Carbon Design migration (All distributions)

We are in the process of migrating Camunda Optimize UI to use the Carbon Design System. Our primary focus is to bring the Optimize UI in line with other Camunda products, providing a consistent and seamless experience across the entire ecosystem. With this migration, we will also adhere to accessibility best practices, ensuring that our application is usable by a broader range of users.

The migration to the Carbon Design System for Camunda Optimize is an ongoing effort. We have successfully migrated modals, tables, and popovers, ensuring these components seamlessly integrate into the new design. While the functionality you love remains intact, you can expect a refreshing new UI that aligns with the Carbon Design System.
