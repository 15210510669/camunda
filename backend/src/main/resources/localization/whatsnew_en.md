## Rolling dates for date variables

In addition to fixed date ranges, it is now possible to set rolling values such as “Today”, “This week” or “in the past 5 months” within your date variable filters.

## New Flow Node Duration Filter

In addition to the instance duration filter, a new duration filter is added to be able to filter instances where one or more flow nodes took a certain time span for their execution. For instance, you can filter process instances where a flow node took more than three days or less than five seconds. 
## Assignee and Candidate Group filters

A new filter is added that allows you to include/exclude process instances where any of the user tasks has a specific Assignee or Candidate group.
