## Descriptions for reports and dashboards (All distributions)
A description of how to “read” vizualized data and context why exactly this data is displayed greatly improves readability of reports and dashboards. With 3.10 we introduced Text Reports that can be added as tiles, similar to other reports and allow to place descriptions directly beside reports. With this release we added description fields that are directly related to reports and dashboards. 


## Carbon Design migration (All distributions)
We are in the process of migrating Camunda Optimize UI to use the Carbon Design System. Our primary focus is to bring the Optimize UI in line with other Camunda products, providing a consistent and seamless experience across the entire ecosystem. With this migration, we will also adhere to accessibility best practices, ensuring that our application is usable by a broader range of users.

The migration to the Carbon Design System for Camunda Optimize is an ongoing effort. We have already successfully migrated modals, tables, and popovers, ensuring that these components seamlessly integrate into the new design. While the functionality you love remains intact, you can expect a refreshing new UI that aligns with the Carbon Design System.
