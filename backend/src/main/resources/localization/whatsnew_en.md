## Set and Track Time-Based Goals

Set data-driven service level agreements (SLAs) on how long all your processes should take so you can quickly identify which processes are underperforming.

## KPI Reports

Create reports and alerts tracking percentages like fully automated instances or incident rate (%), plus SLA statistics on durations like P99 or P95 duration in addition to minimum, median, and maximum.

## Improved UX

Rename variables in plain language, filter out noisy outlier analysis heatmaps, and apply rolling date filters to your dashboards to focus on the most important data.
