## New Date Variable Filter Options

In addition to fixed range filters for date variables, this release adds support for relative and rolling date variable filters. This allows you to set filters for date variable values like "Today", "This week" or "in the past 5 months". In general, all options that were already available for instance start- and end-date filters are now also possible for date variables.
