## Dashboard Filters

On dashboards, it is now possible to filter all included reports by state, date or variable. To do so, add available filters in the dashboard edit mode and use them in the view mode.

## Rolling dates for date variables

In addition to fixed date ranges, it is now possible to set rolling values such as “Today”, “This week” or “in the past 5 months” within your date variable filters.

## New Flow Node Duration Filter

In addition to the instance duration filter, a new duration filter is added to be able to filter instances where one or more flow nodes took a certain time span for their execution. For instance, you can filter process instances where a flow node took more than three days or less than five seconds.

## Assignee and Candidate Group filters

A new filter is added that allows you to include/exclude process instances where any of the user tasks has a specific Assignee or Candidate group.

## Include undefined/null values when filtering by variable

When filtering by variables, there is a new option in each variable type that allows you to exclude or include `null` or `undefined` values in the result for the selected filter.

## Variable Aggregation Reports

A new view option has been added for process reports. This new option allows creating reports that show an aggregation (e.g. Sum or Average) of the values of a variable for a process.

## Create Process Reports from Templates

With this release it is now possible to create process reports based on predefined templates. For this there is a new dialog after clicking the New Process Report option that allows selecting the process definition and template for the new report.
