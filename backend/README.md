# Camunda Optimize REST API

The following REST API is providing backend service based on elasticsearch(ES) to perform aggregation of the 
data that has been previously imported into elasticsearch(ES) instance\cluster.

## ES Installation 

please not that you have to add following configuration to your _/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml_

```
script.engine.groovy.inline.aggs: on
```

### Enabling scripts debug logging

you have to add following line to your elastic search startup jvm options, the order does not play any 
significant role

```
-Djava.security.policy=file:////etc/elasticsearch/.java.policy
```

here is how one could do that on Ubuntu 

```
sudo vi /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
sudo service elasticsearch stop
sudo service elasticsearch start
```

content of policy file: 

```
grant {
   permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "*";
};
```

after that you can add following code to your groovy script to test it

```
import  org.elasticsearch.common.logging.*
logger = ESLoggerFactory.getLogger('myscript')
logger.info("TEST")
```

## REST API

in order to run API you have to run 
```
org.camunda.optimize.Main
```
class as a normal class, which will start up embedded Jetty server with listener on port 8080 and endpoints
providing basic operations

to run from command line please execute following from root folder of the project

```
mvn -DskipTests clean package
java -jar ./es-java/es-java-rest/target/es-java-rest-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Authentication

The whole Optimize REST API is secured. To access it you need to authenticate, which returns a security token. Whenever you send a request you always need to provide that token in the header.

In order to check if you are authenticated or not you can use following request

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/authentication/test
```

which will reply with something like 

```
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1"/>
<title>Error 401 </title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>HTTP ERROR: 401</h2>
<p>Problem accessing /api/authentication/test. Reason:
<pre>    Unauthorized</pre></p>
<hr /><i><small>Powered by Jetty://</small></i>
</body>
</html>
```

since you did not provide any valid bearer token. In order to perform authentication for the first time 
one has to send POST request with username and password to /authenticate endpoint

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/api/authentication -d '{ "username":"admin", "password": "admin"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

which will return a Bearer token 

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTQ4Mzk2NTMyNn0.8LtTNQCygAvajH_HeXAkOCFPi20e-3KHPlC6D009HUg
```

that can be used to access a secure endpoint 

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/authentication/test -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTQ4Mzk2NTMyNn0.8LtTNQCygAvajH_HeXAkOCFPi20e-3KHPlC6D009HUg"
```

to logout

```
curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/api/authentication/logout -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.S8EUdXzC3pL5UHz11aBwx36OBlYEL02FS5GH81XFneE"
```

### Trigger data import from engine to elasticsearch

Whenever you start Optimize, the import is triggered automatically. However, you can still do that manually by 
sending the following request:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/api/import -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.S8EUdXzC3pL5UHz11aBwx36OBlYEL02FS5GH81XFneE"
```

The response tells you, if the import was successfully triggered.

### Enunciate REST-API documentation

You can generate documentation for the REST-API using [enunciate](http://enunciate.webcohesion.com/).
Just run the following command:

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdocs
realpath es-java/es-java-rest/target/docs/apidocs/index.html | xargs firefox
```

[Here](https://hq2.camunda.com/jenkins/optimize/view/All/job/camunda-optimize/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/backend/target/docs/apidocs/index.html) you can also find the documentation of the last successful build.
