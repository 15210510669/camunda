   * instance unchanged. This method already exists for software that is building support for
   * multi-tenancy, and already wants to use this API during its development. As support for
   * multi-tenancy is added to Zeebe, each of the commands that implement this method may start to
   * take effect. Until this warning is removed, anything described below may not yet have taken

   * etc.) resulting from this command.
   *
   * <h1>Multi-tenancy</h1>
   *
   * <p>Multiple tenants can share a Zeebe cluster. Entities can be assigned to a specific tenant
   * using an identifier. Only that tenant can access these entities.
   *
   * <p>Any entities created before multi-tenancy has been enabled in the Zeebe cluster, are
   * assigned to the {@link #DEFAULT_TENANT_IDENTIFIER}.
   *
   * <h2>Inferred ownership</h2>
   *
   * It's not always necessary to specify the {@code tenantId} explicitly. In many cases, the owning
   * tenant can be inferred.
   *
   * <p>For example, an instance of a process that is owned by tenant {@code "ACME"} can be created
   * without specifying the {@code tenantId} explicitly. The created process instance is then owned
   * by {@code "ACME"} as well.
   *
   * <p>If no tenant is explicitly specified and the tenant could not be inferred, then the command
   * is rejected.
   *
   * <h2>Shared entities</h2>
   *
   * <p>Some entities (i.e. process and decision definitions) can be shared among all tenants using
   * the {@link #SHARED_TENANT_IDENTIFIER}.
   *
   * <p>When referring to shared entities in your command, the owning tenant may be inferred from
   * the client's access.
   *
   * <p>For example, an instance of a process that is shared among all tenants can be created
   * without specifying the {@code tenantId} explicitly, if the client only has access to one
   * specific tenant. In that case, the tenant owning the created process instance can be inferred
   * from the client's access.
   *
   * @param tenantId the identifier of the tenant to specify for this command, e.g. {@code "ACME"}
   * @return the builder for this command with the tenant specified
   * @since 8.3
