# Default values for Tasklist Preview Environments

# The values file follows helm best practices https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/
# This means:
#   * Variable names should begin with a lowercase letter, and words should be separated with camelcase.
#   * Every defined property in values.yaml should be documented. The documentation string should begin with the name of the property that it describes, and then give at least a one-sentence description

ingress:
  # Defines the domain under which to expose the ingress
  domain: tasklist.camunda.cloud

git:
  # Defines the branch name to use for annotating resources
  branch: master
  # Defines the repository URL to use for annotating resources
  repoUrl: https://github.com/camunda/tasklist

# Configuration of the camunda-platform chart, in particular we disable some features that
# we don't want to deploy.
# We also change the `fullNameOverride` and `zeebeClusterName`
# to simpler values, so we don't duplicate the ReleaseName everwhere
# (as that's already reflected in the Namespace and can be quite long).
