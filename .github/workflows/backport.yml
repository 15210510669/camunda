# Backport merged pull request
#
# Some changes need to be copied to older versions.
# We use the backport Github Action to automate this process.
# You can activate this workflow to backport your changes.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Label the pull request with a backport label (e.g. the label `backport maintenance/8.1` indicates
#    that we want to backport this pull request to the `maintenance/8.1` branch).
#   - if the pull request is not yet merged, it will be automatically backported as soon as the pull
#     request is merged.
#   - if the pull request is already merged, create a comment on the pull request that contains
#     `/backport` to trigger this workflow.
# 2. The Github Actions bot comments on the pull request once it finishes:
#   - When successful, a new backport pull request was automatically created.
#   - If it failed, you'll need to cherry-pick the commits manually.
