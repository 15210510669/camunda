## PR Checklist

- [ ] This PR is targeting the correct branch (see details below):
  <details>
  <summary>If it's a fix during a regular release</summary>
  This PR should target only the release branch (as this branch will be later merged into master)
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>If it's a fix for a PATCH release</summary>
  This PR should target the maintenance branch AND you have to make sure it is manually cherry-picked to the master branch as well, since the maintenance branch DOES NOT get merged back to master.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Otherwise (normal task)</summary>
  This PR should target the master branch
